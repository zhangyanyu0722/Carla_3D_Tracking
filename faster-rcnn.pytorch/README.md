# Joint Monocular 3D Vehicle Detection and Tracking

![](../imgs/teaser.gif)

We present a novel framework that jointly detects and tracks 3D vehicle bounding boxes.
Our approach leverages 3D pose estimation to learn 2D patch association overtime and uses temporal information from tracking to
obtain stable 3D estimation.

## Quick start
In this section, you will train a model from scratch, test our pretrained models, and reproduce our evaluation results.

### Execution

For running a whole pipeline (training and testing):
```bash
# Generate predicted bounding boxes for object proposals

# Step 00 (Optional) - Training on GTA dataset
./run_train.sh

# Step 01 - Generate bounding boxes
./run_test.sh

# For 3D AP evaluation, please follow the step list in [3d-tracking](../3d-tracking/object-ap-eval)
# The bbox results of 3D AP are the 2D detection evaluation.
```
