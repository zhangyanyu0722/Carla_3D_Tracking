# PyMOT

## Introduction
The Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) metrics "multiple object tracking precision" (*MOTP*) and "multiple object tracking accuracy" (*MOTA*) allow for objective comparison of tracker characteristics [0].
The *MOTP* shows the ability of the tracker to estimate precise object positions, independent of its skill at recognizing object configurations, keeping consistent trajectories, and so forth [0].
The *MOTA* accounts for all object configuration errors made by the tracker, false positives, misses, mismatches, over all frames [0].

![MOT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Videmo/pymot/master/mot-tracks.png)

This is a python implementation which determines the *MOTP* and *MOTA* metrics from a set of ground truth tracks and a set of hypothesis tracks given by the tracker to be evaluated.

## Usage
**pymot** can be used both as a script and a python class to use from your own code.
```
$ pymot.py -h
usage: pymot.py [-h] -a GROUNDTRUTH -b HYPOTHESIS [-c] [-v VISUAL_DEBUG_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a GROUNDTRUTH, --groundtruth GROUNDTRUTH
  -b HYPOTHESIS, --hypothesis HYPOTHESIS
  -c, --check_format
  -v VISUAL_DEBUG_FILE, --visual_debug_file VISUAL_DEBUG_FILE
  -i IOU, --iou IOU     iou threshold
```
You have to feed `pymot.py` with a groundtruth file and a hypothesis file.

### Script
Given groundtruth tracks and hypotheses according to *input formats*, `pymot.py` can be used as a script.

### Class
**pymot** comes with a `MOTEvaluation` class. Sample usage:
```python
from pymot import MOTEvaluation
groundtruth = <see format below>
hypotheses = <see format below>
evaluator = MOTEvaluation(groundtruth, hypotheses)
evaluator.getMOTA()
evaluator.getMOTP()
evaluator.getRelativeStatistics()
evaluator.getAbsoluteStatistics()
```

## Input formats
`pymot.py` expects json input files.
### Groundtruth
The groundtruth json format looks like this and is [sloth](https://github.com/cvhciKIT/sloth) compatible:
```json
[
    {
        "frames": [
            {
                "timestamp": 0.054, 
                "num": 0, 
                "class": "frame", 
                "annotations": [
                    {
                        "dco": true, 
                        "height": 31.0, 
                        "width": 31.0, 
                        "id": "sheldon", 
                        "y": 105.0, 
                        "x": 608.0 
                    }
                ]
            }, 
            {
                "timestamp": 3.854, 
                "num": 95, 
                "class": "frame", 
                "annotations": [
                    {
                        "dco": true, 
                        "height": 31.0, 
                        "width": 31.0, 
                        "id": "sheldon", 
                        "y": 105.0, 
                        "x": 608.0 
                    }, 
                    {
                        "dco": true, 
                        "height": 38.0, 
                        "width": 29.0, 
                        "id": "leonard", 
                        "y": 145.0, 
                        "x": 622.0
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "class": "video", 
        "filename": "/cvhci/data/multimedia/bigbangtheory/bbt_s01e01/bbt_s01e01.idx"
    }
]
```
The `frames` list contains a list of annotated frames. Frames from groundtruth and hypothesis are synchronized by the `timestamp`. Each annotation in the `annotation` list consists of bounding box values (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height`), and an `id`. The `dco` flag stands for *do not care* and can be used to mark hard to track targets, e.g. because of occlusion. Thus, a tracker which does not find the target will not be penalized, whereas a tracker which finds the target won't be punished (with a false positive) either.

### Hypotheses
```json
[
    {
        "frames": [
            {
                "timestamp": 0.054, 
                "num": 0, 
                "class": "frame", 
                "hypotheses": [                    
                    {
                        "height": 31.0, 
                        "width": 31.0, 
                        "id": "sheldon", 
                        "y": 105.0, 
                        "x": 608.0 
                    }
                ]
            }, 
            {
                "timestamp": 3.854, 
                "num": 95, 
                "class": "frame", 
                "hypotheses": [
                    {
                        "height": 31.0, 
                        "width": 31.0, 
                        "id": "sheldon", 
                        "y": 105.0, 
                        "x": 608.0
                    }, 
                    {
                        "height": 38.0, 
                        "width": 29.0, 
                        "id": "leonard", 
                        "y": 145.0, 
                        "x": 622.0
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "class": "video", 
        "filename": "/cvhci/data/multimedia/bigbangtheory/bbt_s01e01/bbt_s01e01.idx"
    }
]
```
The hypotheses json file format is equal to the groundtruth json file format, despite the missing `dco` attribute and the `annotations` key got renamed to `hypotheses`.

## Results
Besides *MOTA* and *MOTP*, **pymot** calculates the following performance measures:

1. Lonely ground truth tracks (ground truth tracks without any overlapping hypothesis)
1. Lonely hypothesis tracks (hypothesis tracks without any overlapping ground truth)
1. False positives
1. Misses
1. Mismatches
    1. Recoverable mismatches. One ground truth track is covered by two different hypothesis tracks. Later steps in a tracking pipeline can easily fuse the two hypothesis tracks, e.g. by using identification. This is a novel performance measure.
    1. Non-recoverable mismatches. Two ground truth tracks are covered by a single hypothesis track. It is harder to split the hypothesis track into two tracks in later pipeline steps. This is a novel performance measure.

### Track statistics
```
Lonely ground truth tracks 0
Total ground truth tracks 2
Lonely hypothesis tracks 0
Total hypothesis tracks 2
```

### Absolute statistics
`getAbsoluteStatistics()`
```json
{
    "correspondences": 3, 
    "covered ground truth tracks": 2, 
    "covering hypothesis tracks": 2, 
    "false positives": 0, 
    "ground truth tracks": 2, 
    "ground truths": 3, 
    "hypothesis tracks": 2, 
    "lonely ground truth tracks": 0, 
    "lonely hypothesis tracks": 0, 
    "mismatches": 0, 
    "misses": 0, 
    "non-recoverable mismatches": 0, 
    "recoverable mismatches": 0, 
    "total overlap": 3.0
}

```

### Relative statistics
`getRelativeStatistics()`
```json
{
    "MOTA": 1.0, 
    "MOTP": 1.0, 
    "false positive rate": 0.0, 
    "mismatch rate": 0.0, 
    "miss rate": 0.0, 
    "non-recoverable mismatch rate": 0.0, 
    "recoverable mismatch rate": 0.0, 
    "track precision": 1.0, 
    "track recall": 1.0
}
```

## Implementation notes
Corresponding ground truth annotations and hypotheses can be found if they are nearby in time. The `sync_delta` defaults to 0.001s to compensate for floating point rounding errors.

The best matching of all ground truth annotations to all hypotheses is found by Munkre's algorithm (also know as the Hungarian algorithm). It uses the intersection-over-union (IOU) ratio of bounding boxes. By default only bounding boxes with an IOU of more than 0.2 are considered for matching.

## 3D MOT scoring
The subdirectory `3d` contains a collection of scripts for 3D MOT scoring developed by Keni Bernardin for the CLEAR2007 evaluation [1].

`MOTScore.pl` computes the performance measures in the same way as **pymot** does, except for mapping groundtruth and hypothesis based on Euclidean distance.
The file format differs from **pymot**'s. Please refer to the [readme file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Videmo/pymot/master/3d/Readme_MOTscore.txt) and [this whitepaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Videmo/pymot/master/papers/clear2007-evaluation-plan.pdf) for the file format specification.

`scoreAll.py` is a wrapper around `MOTScore.pl` to work on a set of groundtruth label files and hypothesis files.
Please refer to its [readme file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Videmo/pymot/master/3d/Readme_scoreAll.txt).

**pymot** and the 3D MOT scoring script use the same underlying algorithm for tracking evaluation.
We thus aim to make **pymot** capable of scoring 3D trackers and replace the 3D MOT scoring script.
